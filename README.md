# Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam Intelligent Systems Program


**Course Objective**

Knowledge and understanding: at the end of the course, the students will be familiar with basic knowledge of some of the core aspects of AI: state-space representations, search, adversarial search, logic, automated reasoning, reasoning with uncertainty and vagueness and machine learning. Applying knowledge and understanding: students will be able to implement basic (adversarial) search algorithms, as well as knowledge based and adaptive methods to build Intelligent Agents. Making judgements: the students will have a basic understanding of the ethical and societal implications of the developements in AI. Communication skills: students will be able to write a scientific reports about an original research question in a group of students. Learning skills: students will be trained in acquiring a set of complex AI related topics in a restricted period of time, come up with an original research question and perform the necessary (empirical) research.


**Course Content**

The course will provide an introduction to some of the basic concepts of Artificial Intelligence, such as search, adversarial search, knowledge representation and machine learning.
