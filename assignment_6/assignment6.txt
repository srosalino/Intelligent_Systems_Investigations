My manual calculations results match the code output. This means that the constructed Knowledge Base has two models. Meaning that the fist variable 
combination assignment of A = True, B = True, C = True and the second combination of A = False, B = True, C = True make all the clauses evaluate
to true, and thus, they are called models of the Knowledge Base. As we found at least one model (in this case we even found two), this Knowledge Base
is considered satisfiable.




Since the two models of the Knowledge Base are (A = True, B = True, C = True, D = True) and (A = True, B = False, C = True, D = True), I do notice a 
pattern that leads to the conclusion that the Knowledge Base entails the formula (A & C & D). That tells us an important insight, that is, whichever
variable assignment combinations that make the Knowledge Base evaluate to true (models), also make the formula (A & C & D) evaluate to true, regardless
of the value assigned to the variable B. That is confirmed by the two models of the Knowledge Base mentioned at the begining, where the value of B is 
irrelevant as long as the formula (A & C & D) evaluates to true. 




My goal was to prove by refutation whether the Knowledge Base entailed the formula (A & C & D) or not. Since all the Knowledge Base formulas were 
already in CNF, I only had to convert the right-side formula (A & C & D) of the entailment to CNF, however, since it was already in CNF, no calculations
were required. Secondly, I proceeded to add the negation of the right-side formula (A & C & D) of the entailment (already in CNF) to the Knowledge Base. 
By applying the SAT solver directly, the results showed that the Knowledge Base is now unsatisfiable, and thus, I have just proved, by refutation, 
that the Knowledge Base indeed entails the formula (A & C & D).
