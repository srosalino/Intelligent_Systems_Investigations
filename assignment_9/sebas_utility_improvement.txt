Sebas's Utility improvement:

# Check whether the opponent has made a legal move
			if state.get_opponents_played_card() is not None:

				# Retrieve the opponent played card
				opponent_played_card = state.get_opponents_played_card() 	

				moves_same_suit = []
				moves_trump_suit = []

				# Get all moves of the same suit as the opponent's played card
				for index, move in enumerate(moves):
					if move[0] is not None and Deck.get_suit(move[0]) == Deck.get_suit(state.get_opponents_played_card()) and Deck.get_rank(move[0]) > Deck.get_rank(state.get_opponents_played_card()):
						moves_same_suit.append(move)

				if len(moves_same_suit) > 0:
					chosen_move = moves_same_suit[0]
					return chosen_move

				#Get all trump suit moves available
			for index, move in enumerate(moves):

				if move[0] is not None and Deck.get_suit(move[0]) == state.get_trump_suit():
					moves_trump_suit.append(move)

			if len(moves_trump_suit) > 0:
				chosen_move = moves_trump_suit[0]
				return chosen_move
